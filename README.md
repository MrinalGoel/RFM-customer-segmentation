# RFM-customer-segmentation

1000+ Views on kaggle :)

RFM is a common business analysis tool that is often used to segment the customers based on Recency (How recent was the customer's purchase?) , Frequency (How frequently does the customer purchase from us?) and Monetary value (How much money does the customer spend?)

Through the RFM attributes, we can distingush customers displaying similar purchase trends and group them into one cluster. Later, the company can use different marketing/promotions to target these clusters based on the customer's purchasing pattern and behaviour.

For example, if there is a segment of customers that have a high frequency of purchase with us, we could offer them loyalty points. We could also send nudges of our sales/offers to our thrifty customer segment that prefer shopping during sales.

In this notebook, we make use of KMeans to cluster different customer types based on the RFM analysis.
